# Submit your question, win a prize

This repo accompanies the competition BBD is running to imrove the number and quality of assessment questions. Please remember to read the [competition detail](https://bbdsoftware.com/downloads/bbd_mailers/2020/Question/Question-TC.html). 

This repo contains an example question (don't worry, this one is not included in our actual assessment). We consider this question to be a beginner level question.

We will archive this repository when competition closes on 21 April 2020.

Structure of a question:

* Each question should be in it's own folder (eg. `example-question`)
* Each question needs a description (in the `Question.md` file)
* Each question needs test definitions (in the `Tests.md` file), you don't have to provide the specific unit tests, just input and expected output.
* You can provide the question and solutions in as many languages as you want (the example contains 5).

Please remember:
* Include at least one set of input and expected output values in your question.
* Include edge cases (if they exist) in yout test definitions.

You have multiple options to submit your question:
* Fork this repo, branch from master and submit a pull request
* Download this repo as a ZIP file, make your changes, and [e-mail the zip file to us](mailto%3Aatcteam%40bbd.co.za%3Fsubject%3DSubmit%20a%20question%2C%20win%20a%20prize).
